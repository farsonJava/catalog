Simple backend servlets made from using the Tomcat Servlet container for studying server-side logic on a lower level.

This project was developed for educational purposes during the course of my studies of the inner workings of servlet containers,
the java-servlet api + HTTP, and design patterns and common implementations of data structures in backend applications. 

In order to run this application you need Tomcat 9+.
